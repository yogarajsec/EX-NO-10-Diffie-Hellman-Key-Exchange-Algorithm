# EX-NO-10-Diffie-Hellman-Key-Exchange-Algorithm

## AIM:
To Implement Diffie Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm 

## Algorithm:

1. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange is used for securely sharing a secret key between two parties over an insecure channel.

2. Initialization: Agree on a large prime number \( p \) and a primitive root \( g \) modulo \( p \) (both are public values).

3. Key Exchange Process: 
   - Each party selects a private key and calculates their public key using the formula \( g^{\text{private key}} \mod p \).
   - Each party then shares their public key with the other.

4. Secret Key Computation: 
   - Each party computes the shared secret key using the received public key and their own private key.

5. Security: The difficulty of computing discrete logarithms ensures that the shared key remains secure even if public values are intercepted.
